This project will require experience with GPU kernel writing and performance optimizations.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty.</strong> Hard. <strong>Duration.</strong> 350 hours</p> <h3 id=description ><a href="#description" class=header-anchor >Description</a></h3> <p>Many ML frameworks are making the move away from vendor-specific libraries &#40;like CUBLAS, CUDNN, etc.&#41; towards more generic, JIT-compiled implementations of ML-related kernels, like BLAS, softmax, ReLU, etc. The reasons for this move are many-fold:</p> <ul> <li><p>Vendor-provided libraries often only work on that vendor&#39;s hardware and software</p> <li><p>These libraries only support certain element types, tensor shapes/sizes, and limited array view/stride/transpose support</p> <li><p>These libraries often expect to be executed from the host, without a device-side launchable equivalent</p> <li><p>These libraries have unreliable build systems or are binary blobs</p> </ul> <p>Improving this state of affairs for Flux will involve using Julia&#39;s existing GPU and compute kernel libraries &#40;e.g KernelAbstractions.jl&#41; to implement various accelerated, cross-vendor routines. These kernels should be both composable and performance competitive with Flux&#39;s current generic code paths. Examples of routines specifically useful for implementing Neural Networks include:</p> <ul> <li><p>GEMM and GEMV</p> <li><p>Softmax</p> <li><p>Batchnorm and Layernorm</p> <li><p>ReLU</p> <li><p>Convolution/correlation</p> </ul> <p>The ideal candidate should have experience with what operations are used in popular ML models and how they are commonly implemented on GPU. This includes experience writing and benchmarking high performance GPU kernels. Because kernels will be required for both training and inference, an understanding of automatic differentiation &#40;AD&#41; is also highly recommended.</p> <p><strong>Mentors.</strong> <a href="https://github.com/jpsamaroo">Julian Samaroo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/darsnack">Kyle Daruwalla</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ToucheSir">Brian Chen</a></p> <h3 id=prerequisites ><a href="#prerequisites" class=header-anchor >Prerequisites</a></h3> <ul> <li><p>Julia language fluency is essential.</p> <li><p>Experience with low-level GPU kernel programming is strongly recommended.</p> <li><p>Experience with common primitive machine learning ops &#40;forwards and backwards passes&#41; and their interaction is recommended.</p> <li><p>Familiarity with existing prior art such as <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn">tiny-cuda-nn</a> is preferred.</p> </ul> <h3 id=your_contributions ><a href="#your_contributions" class=header-anchor >Your contributions</a></h3> <ul> <li><p>A new package containing the optimized kernels and any supporting code for integration into Flux/Flux&#39;s operation library <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/NNlib.jl">NNlib.jl</a>.</p> <li><p>Tests on CI and a simple benchmark harness for the new NN kernel library.</p> <li><p>A proof-of-concept example showing the kernels being used with kernel fusion on device &#40;GPU&#41;.</p> </ul> <h2 id=creating_runnable_training_and_testing_workflows_for_computer_vision_models ><a href="#creating_runnable_training_and_testing_workflows_for_computer_vision_models" class=header-anchor >Creating runnable training and testing workflows for computer vision models</a></h2> <p>Write a suite of scripts that demonstrate how to use <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Metalhead.jl">Metalhead.jl</a> models for a variety of computer vision tasks and allow for ongoing verification of model correctness.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty.</strong> Moderate. <strong>Duration.</strong> 350 hours</p> <h3 id=description__2 ><a href="#description__2" class=header-anchor >Description</a></h3> <p>Metalhead.jl is Flux&#39;s computer vision library and contains a wide range of models along with pre-trained weights. However, it currently lacks a set of examples showcasing how to use the library in complete computer vision workflows. This includes aspects such as integrating data augmentation, manipulating hyperparameters, tracking metrics and evaluating trained models. Simultaneously, Metalhead does not have a comprehensive set of end-to-end tests to ensure all models can be trained to convergence and to catch less obvious performance or correctness regressions. This project will help fill both needs by creating a set of self-contained, runnable scripts which exercise the functionality of Metalhead models across a number of tasks. The choice of models and tasks may vary, but the top priority will be commonly-used ones such as ResNet and image classification.</p> <p>The ideal candidate should have practical experience with training deep learning models for computer vision tasks, as well as sufficient familiarity with Julia to work independently with complex libraries &#40;e.g. Flux&#41; on a medium-sized codebase. Direct experience using Metalhead.jl is not required but highly recommended. </p> <p><strong>Mentors.</strong> <a href="https://github.com/ToucheSir">Brian Chen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/darsnack">Kyle Daruwalla</a>, <a href="https://github.com/theabhirath">Abhirath Anand</a> </p> <h3 id=prerequisites__2 ><a href="#prerequisites__2" class=header-anchor >Prerequisites</a></h3> <ul> <li><p>Julia language fluency is essential.</p> <li><p>Github CI and experience with GH Actions is strongly suggested.</p> <li><p>Experience with more than one ML task &#40;e.g. image classification, autoregressive language modeling, etc.&#41;.</p> <li><p>Familiarity with prior art is preferred:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/tkf/BenchmarkCI.jl">BenchmarkCI.jl</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://speed.juliagpu.org">JuliaGPU speed center</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://benchmark.tansongchen.com/TaylorDiff.jl">TaylorDiff benchmarking site</a></p> </ul> </ul> <h3 id=your_contributions__2 ><a href="#your_contributions__2" class=header-anchor >Your contributions</a></h3> <ul> <li><p>A new FluxML package, FluxBenchmarks.jl, that will perform configurable benchmarking across our ML stack.</p> <li><p>Github Actions integration for FluxBenchmarks.jl to invoke the tool from PRs.</p> <li><p>A benchmarking suite that will build your experience with different types of ML models and operations across the stack.</p> </ul> <h2 id=tape_based_automated_differentiation_engine_in_julia ><a href="#tape_based_automated_differentiation_engine_in_julia" class=header-anchor >Tape based automated differentiation engine in Julia</a></h2> <p>Write a new AD &#40;automated differentiation&#41; engine in Julia and integrate it into the FluxML environment. The AD engine will be used for the typical DNN architectures.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty.</strong> Hard. <strong>Duration.</strong> 350 hours</p> <h3 id=description__3 ><a href="#description__3" class=header-anchor >Description</a></h3> <p>The family of reverse-mode AD engines in Julia consists mostly of Zygote, Enzyme and the upcoming Diffractor. These packages operate on the intermediate representation &#40;IR&#41; output of the compiler. They are very complex, and it takes many months or years to develop the specialized knowledge required to build these tools. As a result, fixing bugs or adding features is a time consuming task for non-expert developers. </p> <p>In this project we aim to solve this problem by using a simple and yet very effective approach: tapes. This &quot;lower-tech&quot; tape-based AD engine will be easier to maintain while offering fewer features than the existing, complex engines. Tape based automated differentiation is in use in PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Jax. Despite their simplicity, taped-based ADs are the main tool in such successful deep learning frameworks. While PyTorch, Tensorflow and Jax are monoliths, the FluxML ecosystem consists of several packages and a new AD engine can be added quite easily. We will make use of the excellent ChainRules and NNlib packages and make the AD integrate with Flux.jl and Lux.jl.</p> <p><strong>Mentors.</strong> <a href="https://github.com/MariusDrulea">Marius Drulea</a>, <a href="https://github.com/darsnack">Kyle Daruwalla</a></p> <h3 id=prerequisites__3 ><a href="#prerequisites__3" class=header-anchor >Prerequisites</a></h3> <ul> <li><p>Strong knowledge of graph processing algorightms</p> <li><p>Familiarity with the machine learning methods: forward and backward pass and gradient descent</p> <li><p>Familiarity with one of the machine learning libraries: FluxML, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Jax</p> <li><p>Good programming skills in any of the folowing languages is required: Julia, Python, C/C&#43;&#43;, Java, C#</p> <li><p>Julia language is nice to know, but not an absoute requierement</p> </ul> <h3 id=your_contributions__3 ><a href="#your_contributions__3" class=header-anchor >Your contributions</a></h3> <ul> <li><p>Write a new AD engine.
