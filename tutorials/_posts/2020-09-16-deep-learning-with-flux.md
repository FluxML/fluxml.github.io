This is a quick intro to [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) loosely based on [PyTorch's tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html). It introduces basic Julia programming, as well Zygote, a source-to-source automatic differentiation (AD) framework in Julia. We'll use these tools to build a very simple neural network.
